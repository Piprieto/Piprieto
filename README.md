Hi there! I'm Pilar 👋


I’m passionate about technology and science. I enjoy tech tinkering and love exploring how things work.

👩‍💻 I’m currently studying at 42 Urduliz, where I keep learning and growing every day in a practical, collaborative environment.


I’ve worked on several projects in C and I’m currently diving deeper into Python, aiming to expand my skills and master the language. I also want to diversify my learning by exploring new tools, technologies, and other programming languages.

I’m especially interested in artificial intelligence and data analysis, and I’m motivated to keep developing in these areas through real-world projects that challenge me and help me keep evolving.

🚀 Here, I’ll be sharing my projects, experiments, and my continuous learning journey. Let’s keep building and exploring!
