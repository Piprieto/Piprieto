# **Hi there! I'm Pilar 👋**


I’m passionate about technology and science. I enjoy tech tinkering and love exploring how things work.

👩‍💻 I’m currently studying at **42 Urduliz**, where I keep learning and growing every day in a practical, collaborative environment.


I’ve worked on several projects in **C** and I’m currently diving deeper into **Python**, aiming to expand my skills and master the language. I also want to diversify my learning by exploring new tools, technologies, and other programming languages.

I’m especially interested in **IA and data analysis**, and I’m motivated to keep developing in these areas through real-world projects that challenge me and help me keep evolving.

🚀 Here, I’ll be sharing my projects, experiments, and my continuous learning journey. Let’s keep building and exploring!
